## Background and Overview

### Project Overview

AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India, is currently operational in three cities: Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. They plan to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years. However, they are facing a challenge where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service.

To address this issue, the management has requested their supply chain analytics team to track the 'On time' and 'In Full' delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues. The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure 'On-time delivery (OT) %', 'In-full delivery (IF) %', and 'On Time in Full (OTIF) %' of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

### Project Deliverables:

    1. Supply Chain Performance Dashboard:
        A interactive dashboard that tracks important metrics such as:
        --> Volume of Life (VOL)
        --> Fill Rate
        --> Inventory Turns
        --> Lead Time , etc.
        Product-level insights to help stakeholders understand the performance of individual products and identify areas for improvement.
    2. Presentation:
        A clear and concise presentation that summarizes the key findings and insights from the dashboard.

## Data Structure and Overview

The data used in this project comes from various sources within AtliQ Mart's operations, including sales data, inventory data, and more. This data is then processed and visualized in Power BI ans has more than 100,000 rows.



## Executive Summary

### Insight 1: Service Level Tracking

Our service level performance metrics indicate that we have opportunities for improvement. Our On-Time Delivery (OTD) rate was 59.06%, which is below our target of 86.09%. Similarly, our On-Time In-Full (OTIF) rate was 29.02%, which is short of our target of 65.91%. Our In-Full rate was 52.78%, which is below our target of 76.51%. However, we did perform well in terms of our VOFR rate, which was 96.59%. Our LIFR was 65.96%, which is a positive indicator of our service level performance. In terms of order volume, we received a total of 32,000 orders, with an order frequency of 57,000 orders. Unfortunately, we had 458,000 orders that were not shipped. Notably, our total ordered quantity was a significant 13 million units, highlighting the scale of our operations.

### Insight 2: Monthly Performance Metrics

Our OTIF rate performance has shown a steady improvement since May, indicating a positive trend in our order fulfillment process. However, if we look at the bigger picture, we can see that our OTIF rate started at 28.87% in March, then dipped to 27.98% in April, before picking up momentum and steadily increasing to its current level of 29.39% in August. In June, our OTIF rate was 28.72%, which was a slight below from the previous month, and then it continued to increase in July to 29.35% and finally to 29.39% in August.

### Insight 3: Top 5 Products Ordered By Customers

Our top 5 products by order volume are a mix of milk and curd products. The Am Milk 250 product was the clear leader, with an impressive 1.28 million orders. The Am 100 Milk product was a close second, with 1.28 million orders. The Am 500 product was also a strong performer, with 1.25 million orders. The Am Curd 50 and Am Curd 100 products rounded out the top 5, with 1.12 million and 1.11 million orders, respectively. These products are clearly in high demand, and we should focus on ensuring that we have sufficient inventory and production capacity to meet this demand.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we hope to provide AtliQ Mart with the insights they need to optimize their supply chain operations and make data-driven decisions.

## Future Work

Going forward, we plan to incorporate more data sources into our analysis and create more complex visualizations to provide even deeper insights into the supply chain operations.
